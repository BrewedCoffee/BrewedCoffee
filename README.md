### 👋 Hello! I'm a curious and eager student at the University of Waterloo. 
🏫 I’m currently learning C++ and Python. I've just completed ECE 150, my first programming course!
👯 I love sharing ideas and working together with peers.
⚡ If you ever need a voice actor, I'm your guy!
🏦 Looking for internship and co-op opportunities.
